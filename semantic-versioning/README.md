# Semantic Versioning

This directory contains XSLT functions for working with semantic version numbers:

* `x3f:semver-compare`: Compare two semantic version strings for precedence. This function can also preprocess the input strings in certain ways to make them valid as semantic version strings.

For background information about semantic versioning, see [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org).
